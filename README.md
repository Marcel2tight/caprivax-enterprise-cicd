Caprivax CI/CD Platform 
Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure-as-Code & Automated Observability on GCP

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete architecture for a multi-environment CI/CD platform deployed on Google Cloud Platform. It utilizes a "Modular Monorepo" pattern to manage Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), automated server hydration, and a full observability stack.

Key Highlights:
Separation of Planes: Logic divided into a "Management Plane" (Control Center) and "Data Plane" (Dev/Staging/Prod).
Binary-to-Metric Pipeline: Automated flow from Java source code to Prometheus-scraped JVM metrics.
Artifact Integrity: Immutable versioning using Nexus Repository Manager for reliable rollbacks.
Full-Stack Monitoring: Real-time health visualization via Grafana, monitoring JVM heap, CPU, and Uptime.

Tech Stack & Tools
Infrastructure: Terraform (Modular HCL)
CI/CD: Jenkins (Multistage Groovy Pipelines)
Build Tool: Maven (Customized with Spring Boot Repackaging)
Config Management: Ansible
Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (VPC, Compute Engine, IAM)
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Micrometer
Artifacts: Sonatype Nexus

Deployment Logic
1. The Management Plane (The Director)
The platform is anchored by a hydrated Manager VM. This acts as the Jenkins Controller, Nexus Repository, and Monitoring Hub. It orchestrates the lifecycle of the entire fleet.

2. Automated Application Lifecycle
Build: Jenkins compiles the SmartOps API into an executable "Fat JAR".
Quality:SonarQube scans for vulnerabilities and code smells.
Deploy: Ansible fetches the versioned JAR from Nexus and deploys it to target VMs, configuring the `systemd` unit for high availability.

3. Observability Stack

Deployed as a Docker-composed stack, featuring:
Prometheus: Scrapes `/actuator/prometheus` endpoints across the fleet.
Grafana: Visualizes health via Dashboard 11378 (JVM Micrometer Statistics).
Fleet Management: Multi-target scraping with environment-based labels (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

🔒 Security Posture
Least Privilege: CI/CD actions performed via dedicated Service Accounts.
Network Isolation: Internal communication restricted to authorized ports (8080 for API, 9090 for Scraping).
Stability: Optimized Management Plane with 2GB Swap configuration for build reliability.

### ��� Technical Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Configuration Drift** | Resolved `systemd` failures by using Ansible to enforce state, ensuring the transition from .war to .jar was synchronized across the fleet. |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Mitigated Jenkins build failures on the Management Plane by implementing a 2GB Linux swapfile and optimizing JVM heap settings. |
| **Observability Gaps** | Instrumented Spring Boot with Micrometer and Prometheus Actuator to move beyond basic "up/down" checks to deep JVM telemetry. |
| **Artifact Portability** | Integrated the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` to repackage standard JARs into executable "Fat JARs," ensuring all dependencies were bundled for cloud deployment. |
