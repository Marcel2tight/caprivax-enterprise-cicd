Caprivax CI/CD Platform 🚀Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure-as-Code & Automated Observability on GCP📌 Project OverviewThis repository contains the complete architecture for a multi-environment CI/CD platform deployed on Google Cloud Platform. It utilizes a Modular Monorepo pattern to manage Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), automated server hydration, and a full observability stack.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe platform is designed with a strict Separation of Planes to ensure stability and security:Management Plane: A centralized GCP Instance hosting Jenkins, Nexus, and the Prometheus/Grafana stack.Data Plane: A distributed network of worker nodes across Dev, Staging, and Production environments.Security: Production workloads are isolated from the public internet, utilizing IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy) for administrative access.🚀 Deployment Logic & Visual Evidence1. Automated Application LifecycleSuccessfully orchestrated a 5-stage pipeline including automated testing, quality gates, and a manual promotion step for Production deployment.<p align="center"><img src="docs/pipeline.png" width="900" alt="Jenkins Pipeline Success"><i>Pipeline executing Build, Nexus Upload, and Multi-Env Deployment.</i></p>2. Full-Stack Observability & AlertingThe platform features proactive monitoring. JVM telemetry is instrumented via Micrometer, scraped by Prometheus, and visualized in Grafana with integrated Slack webhooks.<p align="center"><img src="docs/prometheus-targets.png" width="900" alt="Prometheus Target Health"><i>Prometheus health dashboard showing 4/4 active 'smartops-enterprise-fleet' targets.</i></p><p align="center"><img src="docs/grafana.png" width="48%" /><img src="docs/slack.png" width="48%" /></p><p align="center"><i>Live JVM Telemetry Dashboard (Left) and Automated Slack Notifications (Right).</i></p>🧠 Technical Challenges & SolutionsChallengeSolutionResource ExhaustionMitigated Jenkins build failures by implementing a 2.00 GiB swap file on the Management Plane.Configuration DriftUsed Ansible to enforce consistent state and manage systemd services across environments.Observability GapsInstrumented Spring Boot with Micrometer for deep JVM telemetry (Heap, CPU, Threading).👤 AuthorMarcel Owhonda - Cloud & DevOps EngineerGitHub: @Marcel2tightLinkedIn: Marcel Owhonda
